## Project Description
In order to comprehend the factors that lead to start-up success in India, this project involves analyzing the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. The objective is to find patterns and trends in the data on financing amounts, investor details, and start-up information and to use these revelations to make inferences about the traits of Indian start-ups that are likely to succeed. Utilizing statistical techniques and methods, the study may look at the effects of start-up performance on funding levels, investor diversity, location, industry specialization, innovation, and founding team experience. Investors, business people, and policy makers who want to comprehend the dynamics of the Indian start-up ecosystem and come up with ideas such as start-up promotion may find the analysis' findings helpful.
